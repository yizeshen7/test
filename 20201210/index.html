        <p>Before I was admitted as a TA, one very kind TA reached out through email, asked if there was anything I wish to know on being a teaching assitant. Back then I did have a few questions, though never had the courage to ask, and before I ever had the chance to do so, I became a teaching assitance myself :’). Realizing that being a TA is a lot more than just teaching recitations, want to allocate some space to draw some down here.</p>
<h2 id="Grading"><a href="#Grading" class="headerlink" title="Grading"></a>Grading</h2><img src="../images/10302020.png" alt="A snippet of how the TA OHQ works" style=""><span class="image-caption">A snippet of how the TA OHQ works</span>

<p>In this course all quizes were graded the day students took them, although I have fully expected this coming in as a TA, it was surpringly, how much we interact with each other while we grade.</p>
<p>During grading, we would share how a student struggles to write for loops but overcame to the right solution, ask about each other’s day, laugh at funny drawings student has on paper, when they finished early or have given up on a problem entirely :/.</p>
<p>I thought grading quizzes would be time consuming and hectic, which turned out to be true, but on the other hand, working with a group of peoeple towards the same go, laugh/sturggle together along the way, felt that was one thing that made these Tuesday night more attractice than it should have being.</p>
<h2 id="Hackathon"><a href="#Hackathon" class="headerlink" title="Hackathon"></a>Hackathon</h2><img src="../images/11032020.png" alt="Hype Video :D" style=""><span class="image-caption">Hype Video :D</span>

<p>We host a hackathan every semester, where current course student get to create an applicaiton, with up to 3 other members, within 24 hours. That semester I was in charge of making a hype video for the event that semester, and yeah, I have never done a hype video before :’).</p>
<p>It took me 13 hours to complete the first draft, 6 hours to complete the second draft, and 2 more hours to convince the event lead that I used 19 hours to make this 1 minute video lol. I remember dreaming about making the video during the days bewteen, collecting ideas and making samples of it, multiple footage retakes just to make it match the background music (later I realized there is a speed up feature in Adobe Premiere Pro :’) ).</p>
<p>Looking back, the result was hardly a hype video, and I can definitely do a better job, given the practices I got through the semestr. Nonetheless, putting my skills into use and benefiting others, I was surprised how much more confident/conpedent I felt on being a TA, knowing that I can help people around me in more ways than one.</p>
<h2 id="Term-Project-Mentor"><a href="#Term-Project-Mentor" class="headerlink" title="Term Project Mentor"></a>Term Project Mentor</h2><img src="../images/12102020.png" alt="Placeholder, please don't sue me if you are in the picture :')" style=""><span class="image-caption">Placeholder, please don't sue me if you are in the picture :')</span>

<p>Being honest, I was lucky enough to have great students as my TP mentee to begin with. Every one of my mentee was on time to every meeting, they all past MVP by the deadline, respond to my email spam within a day, and all reached out for help when they needed it, which made my job, so much easier.</p>
<p>It was an honor working with them, and I also learned that, when students hits a threshold on coding proficiency, debugging helps is no longer their top priority. Some wished to tackle a problem they are interested in, some wants a good score to boost their overall grades, and some just want to have some fun. Understand motivation and help to fulfill that, felt that was something I got out of even after being a TP mentor.</p>
<h2 id="Professor-OH"><a href="#Professor-OH" class="headerlink" title="Professor OH"></a>Professor OH</h2><p>Not that I didn’t expect students coming to these, but I was surprised how much less about professor it was, when we did office hour online. During that semester specifically, professor would take students, invite them to a breakout room to talk individually, leaving the rest of queue waiting in the main room with the TA.</p>
<p>Considered myself a listener more than a storyteller, so it was always a bit awkwards stuck with a group of students, looking at each other, trying to find a topic to chat about :’)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, felt that was where I observed the most from other students and TAs. Fake birthday letter someone wrote to their penmate, where the professor got their hawaiian shirt (it was from Amazon), what people ate for their lunch, conversations/stories like these made me reazlied we were much, much more complicated than just TAs/students, and it was nice getting to know a more diverse view of these people, outside of scope of the course :).</p>
<h2 id="Burnout"><a href="#Burnout" class="headerlink" title="Burnout"></a>Burnout</h2><p>This specific TA position requires about 12-15 hours of commitment weekly, which is equivlent to a 12 unit course at the university. Burn out was something that I felt that semester, with turbulance in and outside of the course, I was again a bit lost on my path towards coming semesters. Instead of going it through myself though, the support from students/TA was, overwhleming to say the very least.</p>
<p>Some recognized the time that I put into prepping the recitation, some gave me advices on how I should approach other’s feedback. I got compared to master oogway once (didn’t know what that was and had to search it up lol), listened to others talk about their struggles outside of the course and how they attempted to resolve it.</p>
<p>Looking back, I am still not sure how helpful these was, I felt I have done quite a terrible job at understanding these, but if anything, I was happy that I wasn’t along going through these, and they have helped in more ways than one, as I realized later in my gap semester in S21.</p>
<h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>I guess I was conviced, towards the end of the semester, on why being a TA is ‘fun and exciting’, and something people wish to continue doing ‘until they graduate’. It was less about the materials you get to teach your student, and definitely not the pay :/. for me it was the experience I get, working with people that I look up to, meeting people I would otherwise not have the fortune to meet, and learn about how others approaches problems.</p>
