        <p>Hello! If you are looking at this, whoever you may be, welcome! My name is Yize Shen, a student at Carnegie Mellon University. Want to use this post as an expanded version of the About page, here I would talk about who I am, what my vision of this website is going to be, along with my contact informations.</p>
<h2 id="Who-I-am"><a href="#Who-I-am" class="headerlink" title="Who I am"></a>Who I am</h2><p>Came to the US when I was 13, always find it diffcult to write proper introduction for myself :’). I am, for the most part, a student, but other than that, not super sure what else are there to talk about. I am more of a listener and well, a procrastinator lol.</p>
<p>Being a student at Carnegie Mellon University, always find it hard to think about what I do outside of study lol. Nonetheless, in my free time, usually enjoy playing videos games, from Minecraft to League of Legend, I’ve started playing games ever since I was, 12 I think. Aside from that, took a gap semester in S21, and started reaching out ot things that I didn’t expect myself enjoying lol. Have tried acapella, a little bit of juggling, started watching TV series on Netflix, attempt to learn vector network on Figma, read some books, tried learning ukelele, learned a bit about React, JS, along with Django, started reaching out to people I thought would never cross with my path again. Overall, I did bunch of random things while in this gap semester, and foudn them to be, educational I guess :D.</p>
<h2 id="About-this-website"><a href="#About-this-website" class="headerlink" title="About this website"></a>About this website</h2><p>As mentioned in <a target="_self" href="https://yizeshen7.github.io/about/">About</a>, was planning on using this website as a place for me to record my thoughts, also for anyone who are interested to learn a bit more about the things that I am doing, and hopefully, me :D.</p>
<p>Started writing jounrals to record days in my life in 2019, and found it to be quite helpful. I was able to better understand who I am and what I want, and look back to how I dealt with a situation if anything similar has happened in the past. Now was never intended to share these with anyone, these were meant to just for myself to look at and reflect upon.</p>
<p>Would say the biggest change came from a TA postion I got at Carnegie Mellon Unversity. Towards the end of the semester, I was quite frequently being referred to as ‘mysetery’ and someone they don’t understand. To me my intention and thoughts were staright forward, but also realized that, I have kept too much thoughts to myself. To be honest, I still don’t wish to share what I think in most situations, but thought this blog may be a good medium to post about it. This way people who are intrested (possibly you :D) can take a look at it, and for those who are not, it’s not in their face, and felt this to be a flexible option for both me and everyone else.</p>
<p>Now that being said, do have a pessmistic view on this website. Have being a introvert for some times now, it’s definitely a challenege to explain what I have in mind, and display it on the web. I am not sure how I would be able to keep this up, hopefully there would be no regret, by the time that I look back at this.</p>
<h2 id="Contact-Info"><a href="#Contact-Info" class="headerlink" title="Contact Info"></a>Contact Info</h2><p>Feel free to reachout to me through my email: <a href="mailto:&#121;&#x69;&#x7a;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#x61;&#110;&#100;&#x72;&#101;&#119;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6d;&#x75;&#46;&#x65;&#100;&#117;">&#121;&#x69;&#x7a;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#x61;&#110;&#100;&#x72;&#101;&#119;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6d;&#x75;&#46;&#x65;&#100;&#117;</a></p>
