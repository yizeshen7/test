    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thinking back to my stay, these three puppies were almost always the first thing that cames to my mind. Being someone who never really had a pet, dealing with three was, quite an unique experience.</p><h2 id="Wofie"><a href="#Wofie" class="headerlink" title="Wofie"></a>Wofie</h2><img src="../images/03182018b.jpeg" alt="Wofie, not very happy that the shutter sound woke him up" style="width:80%; height:80%;"><span class="image-caption">Wofie, not very happy that the shutter sound woke him up</span><p>Wofie is the cloest defnition I have, if you asked me what a dog is like 5 years ago. Active, loyal, attention craving, as a Schnauzer with a giant ego, Wofie is, well, not very pleasent to interact with, to say the very least :’).</p><p>I tend prefer peace and quiet, so the sole existance of Wofie has, bothered me a little. He would be running around the house constantly, marking his territory, asserting his dominance over the other two (and sometimes me), if we ever left him unchecked for more than ten minutes. He would come over and yell at us if we are having too much fun without him at the dinner, and brak for hours, just to chase the bird outside away, who is merely trying to built a nest.</p><p>As unpleasent as he was to deal with, as the most straightforward one out of all three, Wofie was the first that I was able to understood. If he barks he wants to go outside, if he growls someone is in his way, and if he does anything else, well, he is probably looking for a treat…</p><p>Thinking back, Wofie might just have being the most brilliant human trainer I have met. He is honest, straightforward, doesn’t hide away his feelings and never overthinks, which helped us greatly to gave him what he wanted.</p><h2 id="Lizzy"><a href="#Lizzy" class="headerlink" title="Lizzy"></a>Lizzy</h2><img src="../images/03182018.jpeg" alt="Lizzy, sleeping on the bed where I sleep :')" style="width:50%; height:50%;"><span class="image-caption">Lizzy, sleeping on the bed where I sleep :')</span><p>A Dachshund and Schnauzer mix, Lizzy remained as my host family’s favorite through my time there. She is ‘Liz’ for host mom, and ‘my baby girl’ for host dad. She enjoys the first 10 minutes of every walk, likes to sleep on the sofa whenever someoen is there, and loves to destory toys, whenever we buy her something squeaky :’).</p><p>Aside from her charisma, Lizzy has a sense of curiocity that can only be found from a puppy. She would come and sniff every package delivered at the front porch, and meeting new people with some lick on the face. In the summer of 2017, that curiocity got her bitten by a rattle snake, along with three nights of stay in the pet hospital. After that the urge of getting to know everything has rapidly cooled down, though still, whenever she would hear someone standing at the door, she would still rush to the door, stand up with her tails swingglings from side to side, just to see who is there.</p><h2 id="Ares"><a href="#Ares" class="headerlink" title="Ares"></a>Ares</h2><img src="../images/03182018c.jpeg" alt="Ares with his innocent look" style="width:80%; height:80%;"><span class="image-caption">Ares with his innocent look</span><p>The host family’s son adopted Ares and named him after the god of war. Contrary to this aggresive name though, as a pit bull, Ares is surprisingly chill and quite, just like me B).</p><p>Sleeping and walking are really the only two activies Ares does. On a typicaly day, he would drag himself to the living room sofa, lay there comfortably until the afternoon, where the host mom (and sometimes I) would take him for a walk. After the walk, he would return to his favorite spot on the sofa, sleep there until the evening, where he would go to my host dad’s room and enjoy the rest of the night there.</p><p>As low energy as Ares sound, he turns into a different dog whenever he is outside. He would drag me forward, dig holes on the ground, bite the leash and growls at me if I am going too slow :’).</p><p>Ares loves anywhere but the house, to the point where he ran away, twice, during the time of my stay. The first time he ran all the way to my high school (which is about 10 minutes by car and 30 minutes by foot), and got carried back by some very kind construction workers across the street. The second time he appeantly he ran to the other side of the hill, it was late at night, all we knew was, he got taken back by a even nicer driver who, eh, almost hit him on the street.</p><p>We now get nervous evertime Ares eyes at the front door lol, though as troublesome as he is, would say Ares has been a great partner whenever I decides to do work at the living room sofa. He never craves for attention, seldomly barks even when there are bird chipping outside, and simply rolls over if he wants some belly scarch, letting me enjoys my afternoon without constantly looking out for him :).</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>It would be an exaggeration compare these dogs to people I lived with during my stay, though I do think back to these interactions, more than any students who were there. Always be on my bed when I wanted to take a nap, swallow food on the floor faster than I could pick them back up, play dead and smile at exactly halfway of a walk, still not sure if I ever enjoyed their company. Nonetheless though, being something that has feelings and emotions, they were one of the first creatures that I actively try to understand, and something that still lingers around my memory, even today :).</p>]]></content>

    <title>Capsule Wardrobe</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Heard about the idea of capsule wardrobe when I started using Notion, thought would be something interesting so gave it a shot. As a quick note that, there are many tutorials/guides regarding capsule wardrobes on the web, simply search ‘capsule wardrobe’ or ‘capsule wardrobe notion/excel’, you should be able to find some good ones :D, here I am just going to post how I do them, hope they would be helpful?</p><img src="../images/06142021.png" alt="What my closet looks like now" style=""><span class="image-caption">What my closet looks like now</span><p>On Notion I tried to categorize clothings in coloumns,</p><ul><li>Item: usually named as primary cateogry - secondary category - color</li><li>Status: If I am using it right now, idle, or no longer in use</li><li>Brand: Well, where I got the cloth from :/</li><li>Time: Gives me an idea on how the condition of the cloth are</li><li>Season: When/what season would be a good time to wear this item</li><li>Type: Pretty useful when I want to filter items through, will talk about that later :D</li></ul><img src="../images/06142021b.png" alt="" style=""><p>What’s nice about Notion is that, you are allowed to create a secondary page inside of items, where you can define more about the product’s feature</p><ul><li>Name | Size | Color | Price: Helps me to find it on the website in case I need to</li><li>Laundry | Fabric: How I should take care of the product</li><li>Notes: I tried to draw down my thoughts every so often, just so I have a opnion on how I feel when wearing it, pretty useful in comparing similar clothings from different stores</li></ul><p>And this excel/table like layout helps me to filter items based on their properties as well, say that I am going to travel to Seattle next week, and wish to find some cloth that’s for cloder weather</p><img src="../images/06142021c.png" alt="" style=""><p>I can simply filter through items that has ‘Cold’ for seasons, and see which one I would like to bring :).</p><p>The upsides of capsule wardrobe were pretty obvious, it’s quite easy to track everything in my closet, what I am wearing right now, what I need to prep for the coming season, which items can be washed together, which item needs special care etc, helps me to reduce the amount of unnesscary stuff I have. Doing this in Notion also helps me to record more informations about the item, just incase I need to buy it again in the future.</p><p>The downsides? Well, the inital set up process can be quite time consuming. I allocated an entire afternoon to get every piece of cloth out of my closet, only to put them back in again, and I don’t even have that much stuff :’). Along with that, the recording process can be a bit repetitive, a lot of times the information that I sometimes put down would only be used once or twice, but felt these are more about my appraoch, rather than the tool/method itself.</p><p>At this point, have being trying this for just about half a year, I enjoy things around me well organized and under control, so recording my closet on Notion, was definitely something that I appreciated during my gap semester.</p>]]></content>

To be honest, I am still not sure, and I completely agree with how mature these social media are compare to mine, how many more people I may be able to reach, if I have posted these there instead.</p><p>With that being said, do felt the flexibility/freedom was the major reason why I chose to do this here. On this site I can post anything, images, videos, short/long paragraphs, and even google map if I really feel like it. Realizing that I tend to change as time progresses, having a site that can synchronusly adapt to who I am, feel this would be a better fit for the purpose on recording my life in the coming years (if I have that much time that is :’) ).</p><p>Along with that, when I tried to sent posts on Facebook, Instagram or WeChat, always felt some kind of pressure, wanting to make the post I sent well polished. In contrast, here I simply do whatever I wish, without thinking about audience of these post, and how they would react towards it. Want this site to only be a place to record/express myself, interactions that comes after, are something that I try to stay away from.</p><p>That being said though, I am not against the idea on posting on social medias. I followed a few blog-like acount on WeChat and Medium, and enjoyed them very much. Knowing that it’s more about on what you send, less on where you sent thesse, I am still at this early stage of exploring my options, so wouldn’t be surprised if I change my mind later in the future. Nonetheless, formulating my ideas into words, record my life without worries, these are goals I don’t wish to change, no matter which platform I ended up using :).</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UX desginer at my intern introduced me to vector networks in Figma, a tool to create smooth curves without drawing them myself. Thought it was interesting so gave it a shot.</p><p>The concept of figma vector network were quite simple, you draw a line, and can create nodes within the line, where you get to change curvatures of them based on your preference.</p><p>The execuation? Well</p><img src="../images/05052021.png" alt="Still not sure how I ended up with a dog when trying mimic this cat but" style=""><span class="image-caption">Still not sure how I ended up with a dog when trying mimic this cat but</span><img src="../images/05052021b.png" alt="That's me :/" style=""><span class="image-caption">That's me :/</span><p>I really, really tried, don’t feel like the results are bad, they just feel, weird :/.</p><p>The hardest part I found while doing these was determining where the line should curve, and by how much. Often an extra nodes would make the curve overly sharp to fit the original image, and too little nodes makes the line fits less well with the sample image.</p><p>I did have fun making these though, and felt like, the mere attempt of me trying to re draw these, was something I wish to record here :D.</p>]]></content>

In early March happened to finish one of the anime he recomended called ‘Yuru Camp’, and were talking about how cool it would be, if we could go and camp out for a night or two. As a doer himself, a days later I was informed that Steve is going out camping, and if I wish to join or not.</p><p>Of course I said yes lol, haven’t being outside of the house since April last year, I would take any oppotunity for me to go out and explore. So about a week later, I was picked up by him and his friend Steven in the morning, and went on this two day and one night camping trip :D.</p><p>The overall trip was very nice, we had hot pot on the first night we got there, took a hike half way around the lake, and played Call of Cthulhu before we went to bed.</p><p>Thinking back, I didn’t remember anything specific from the trip, just thought it was a great time talking with them both, and was a necessary break for me with the intern I had in my gap semester.</p><p>Steve and Steven were no doubt some of the more successful students I met, EECE in UCB, interned at Intel, Amazon, and Apple, great multi-taskers with passions towards almost everything. Nonetheless, found myself enjoying other sides of them, game enthusiasts, anime lovers, and experts in Cthulhu mythos. Interacting with them made me rethink how I should balance between school and life, how I can enjoy my time during school, while learning something new :).</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before I was admitted as a TA, one very kind TA reached out through email, asked if there was anything I wish to know on being a teaching assitant. Back then I did have a few questions, though never had the courage to ask, and before I ever had the chance to do so, I became a teaching assitance myself :’). Realizing that being a TA is a lot more than just teaching recitations, want to allocate some space to draw these things down here.</p><h2 id="Grading"><a href="#Grading" class="headerlink" title="Grading"></a>Grading</h2><img src="../images/12102020.png" alt="A snippet of how the TA OHQ works" style=""><span class="image-caption">A snippet of how the TA OHQ works</span><p>In this course all quizes were graded the day students took them, although I have fully expected this coming in as a TA, it was surpringly, how much we interact with each other while we grade.</p><p>During grading, we would share how a student struggles to write for loops but overcame to the right solution, ask about each other’s day, laugh at funny drawings student has on paper, when they finished early or have given up on a problem entirely :/.</p><p>I thought grading quizzes would be time consuming and hectic, which turned out to be true, but on the other hand, working with a group of peoeple towards the same go, laugh/sturggle together along the way, felt that was one thing that made these Tuesday night more attractive than what it could have being :).</p><h2 id="Hackathon"><a href="#Hackathon" class="headerlink" title="Hackathon"></a>Hackathon</h2><img src="../images/12102020b.png" alt="Hype Video :D" style=""><span class="image-caption">Hype Video :D</span><p>We host a hackathan every semester, where current course students get to create an applicaiton using what they learned, with up to 3 other members, within 24 hours. That semester I was in charge of making a hype video for the event that semester, and yeah, I have never done a hype video before :’).</p><p>It took me 13 hours to complete the first draft, 6 hours to complete the second draft, and 2 more hours to convince the event lead that I used 19 hours to make this 1 minute video lol. Looking back, the result I presented was hardly a hype video, nonetheless, putting my skills into use, I was surprised how much more confident/conpedent I felt on being a TA, knowing that I can help people around me in more ways than one.</p><h2 id="Term-Project-Mentor"><a href="#Term-Project-Mentor" class="headerlink" title="Term Project Mentor"></a>Term Project Mentor</h2><img src="../images/12102020c.png" alt="Placeholder, please don't sue me if you are in the picture :')" style=""><span class="image-caption">Placeholder, please don't sue me if you are in the picture :')</span><p>Being honest, I was lucky enough to have great students as my TP mentee to begin with. Every one of my mentee was on time to every meeting, all past MVP by the deadline, respond to my email spam within 2 hours, and all reached out for help when they needed it, which made my job, so, so much easier.</p><p>It was a pleasure working with them, and they also taught me that, when students hit a threshold on coding proficiency, debugging helps were no longer their top priority in TP. Some wished to tackle a problem they are interested in, some wanted a good score to boost their overall grades, and some just tried to have some fun. Understand other’s motivation and help them fulfill that, felt that was something I got out of working with them, even after being a TP mentor.</p><h2 id="Professor-OH"><a href="#Professor-OH" class="headerlink" title="Professor OH"></a>Professor OH</h2><img src="../images/12102020d.png" alt="Picture of regular OH, placeholder" style=""><span class="image-caption">Picture of regular OH, placeholder</span><p>Not that I didn’t expect students coming to these, but I was surprised how much less office hours was about professors, when we did them online. During that semester specifically, professor would take students from the main room, invite to a breakout room to talk individually, leaving the rest of queue waiting in the main room with the moderator TA.</p><p>Considered myself a listener more than a storyteller, so it was always a bit awkwards, stuck with a room full with students, looking at each other, trying to find a topic to chat about :’)</p><p>Nonetheless, felt that was where I observed the most from other students and TAs. Fake birthday letter someone wrote to their penmate, where the professor got their hawaiian shirt (it was from Amazon), what people ate for lunch, conversations/stories like these made me reazlied we were much, much more complicated than just TAs/students, and it was nice getting to know them beyond the scope of the course :).</p><h2 id="Burnout"><a href="#Burnout" class="headerlink" title="Burnout"></a>Burnout</h2><p>This TA position required about 12-15 hours of commitment weekly, equivlent to a 12 unit course at the university. Burn out was something that I felt that semester, with turbulance in and outside of the course, I was again a bit lost on what I wish to do in the future. Instead of going it through myself though, the support from students/TA was, overwhleming to say the very least.</p><p>Some took the time and recognized the time that I put into this job, some gave me advices on how I should approach other’s feedback. I got compared to Master Oogway once (didn’t know what that was and had to search it up lol), listened to others talk about their struggles outside of the course and how they attempted to resolve it.</p><p>Looking back, still not sure how helpful these was, I felt I have done quite a terrible job at understanding these, but if anything, I was happy that I wasn’t along going through these, and appreciated their company along the way.</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>I guess I was conviced, towards the end of the semester, on why being a TA is ‘fun and exciting’, and something people wish to continue doing ‘until they graduate’. It was less about the materials you get to teach your student, and definitely not the pay :/. For me it was more about the experience, working with people that I look up to, talkiong with others that I may not otherwise have the chance to meet, and learn about different ways about approacing problems.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nervous and anxious on this new role, in the two recitation sections that I got assigned to, felt I was taught more by my partner TAs and students, than I have taught them computer science.</p><h2 id="Silence"><a href="#Silence" class="headerlink" title="Silence"></a>Silence</h2><p>I wished to minimize silence in any social interactions, felt the existence of it came from me not asking the right question, or my counterparts being confused on what I said. The mere presence of silence was, akward to me at the time, and that’s exactly what occured in the majority of the recitation when I got up and teach :’). Even when recitations that semester being entirely on zoom, whenever no one answers my call, I can almost touch the akward silence floating in my bedroom.</p><p>Funny enough though, my teaching partner in the eailer recitation was never afraid of that. Instead of panicking (like me), she would intentionally pauses for a moment whenever she finishes a sentence.</p><p>Counterintuitive at the time, but it did make sense. Compare to us, who have learned the material in advance, with the solution right in front of us, students in recitations have little idea on what’s going on, and would oftentime need some moment to process everything we said &amp; asked. By keeping some instances of silence, she allowed students to breath, reflect on the material, recall for the process of problem solving, and also for her to process what she wants to say next :).</p><h2 id="Voice-Fluctuation"><a href="#Voice-Fluctuation" class="headerlink" title="Voice Fluctuation"></a>Voice Fluctuation</h2><p>Rather than observing this from my recitation partner in the latter section, voice fluctuation was something she wished to learn, something her sister is appreantly great at.</p><p>In her words, the way we present material are just as important as the material itself, and by shifting our tone of voice, we highlight things that’s important and deprioritize things that’s not, helping students to understand better, without actively interpreting what we say B).</p><p>As I attempted to learn this alongside with her, different ways of direct student’s attention, was something broader about presentation that I witnessed while she teaches. Things like present visulizations with contrasting colors, align pseudo code with actual solutions, bring up questions that student might have without them asking for it. Felt she understood her student and viewed problems from their perspective, which helps her to allocate time/attention on more confusing topics, gave students some idea on what’s important/will be seen throughout the future, and what’s not.</p><p>On a side note, as much as she tried to fluctuate her voice that semester, she always sounds excited during recitation, not sure if these students ever figured out what was going on….</p><h2 id="Say-‘I-Don’t-Know’"><a href="#Say-‘I-Don’t-Know’" class="headerlink" title="Say ‘I Don’t Know’"></a>Say ‘I Don’t Know’</h2><p>With a weaker grasp on the course material compare to other TAs, even when I left space for silence and bettered my presentation, I often would be just as confused, when student asks follow up questions regarding solutions, or clearfication on course concepts.</p><p>With all the options that I had, admitting incapability were usually my last resort. The moment that I say such phrase, I felt, weak and incompetent as a TA. TAs that I look up to always seem to know what to say, regardless of scenarios in front of them, and everytime that I say ‘I don’t know’, the gap between me and these people just seems to get, wider and larger.</p><p>And that’s where I was taught by my recitation students. Only towards the end of the semester that I realized, most student I met doesn’t mind when I say ‘I don’t know’, they care more about what I say after that. Whether it is to look it up on the web, let my partner TA in recitation chime in, or to do some research and get back to them through email. Understanding that my job is to provide the best possible answer, and I have more than one way of doing so, it did make me feel less intimidated, whenever a student rises their hand in the end of every problem.</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>Rather than saying I learned, these were things that I observed, things that I want to work on in the future. I wish one day I can leave myself some time to think evertime before I speak, convey my emotion and thoughts by rising and lowering my voice, and be more honest with others, including myself.</p><p>Going back to these recitations itself though, knowing that my path would unlikly cross again with these people, I guess it’s now safe for me to say, it was nothing but joy working with them this semester, they were some of the best people I’ve met, and I wish them the best in coming chapters of their jounrey :).</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eg9hjqAIAwI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Multiple time have I thought to write about this, though I never felt I can talk much about this project, despite being the author.</p><p>The idea of 15-112 Simulator came directly from my TP mentor, most of the feature in game are credited to TAs/professors that I talked to, the project itself was below average on both complexity and effective lines of code, not to mention the code structure, I only realized I can create a reuseable button class after I finsihed the project lol.</p><p>Regardless, that four weeks of TP did teach me things outside of computer science and coding, and these are what I wish to draw down here.</p><h2 id="Ask-For-Help"><a href="#Ask-For-Help" class="headerlink" title="Ask For Help"></a>Ask For Help</h2><p>Back in highschool I was pretty reluctant to reach out in most situations, felt like I can handle everything on my own. During TP it was eh, a completely different story. There were times where it took me hours to figure a feature out, only to realize later that it would break other parts of my project :’).</p><p>It was, quite a stressful time not gonna lie, but even then I didn’t really think about asking for help, as I thought my code has became so complex that only a few could comprehend. And as expected, every TA that I met during office hour were quite confused on what I wrote, but it wasn’t a waste of time, to my surprise.</p><p>Some TAs left advices on coding best practices (which I only started following after the term project), some gave me alternatives features that’s more doable, and there was one TA, who sat with me for over an hour, half naked on Zoom, just to figure out how I can run my game without crashing the canvas three seconds later. Nathan, if you ever happens to read this, thank you.</p><p>Being completely honest, even after going through office hours, most of the bug I encountered ended up still not getting resovled, and oftentiems I had to figure ways around them. I rarely got what I asked for when I reachout for help, but the passion shown by these TAs, along with a sense of responsibility they posses, was something that left impressions on me in coming semesters.</p><h2 id="Listening-and-Understanding"><a href="#Listening-and-Understanding" class="headerlink" title="Listening and Understanding"></a>Listening and Understanding</h2><p>One sad things about making a game on a course is that, you only have a limited view on what it is like; and if you want to get a more objective view of it, you have to ask for other’s input.</p><p>And this was probably the single thing that I appreciate the most, being forced to ask for opnions and feedbacks, consantly. I learned to pick up words that my counterpart is using, rephrase what they are trying to convey, and ask for clearfications whenever I don’t understand.</p><p>Besides gaining experience on reaching out, was surprised how many idas I got just by talking with others. Almost every feature in the game were taken inspiration from one of the professor/TA/student who are involved in the course at the time. Compare to doing things solely by myself, things does get a lot eaiser when you have other people by your side helping you out.</p><p>This was also the time where I realized that, yeah everyone in CMU is smarter than me, as much as I don’t want to admit :’).</p><h2 id="Reflecting-on-College"><a href="#Reflecting-on-College" class="headerlink" title="Reflecting on College"></a>Reflecting on College</h2><p>Back in highschool, I was pretty excited about college, thought it would be a time to learn something new, and a place to change myself a little. TP season happens to be the time where a global pandemic hits, so I ended up moving back to California to live with my family.</p><p>Sitting in my old bedroom, realized that, after a semester of college, I am still very much the same person lol. And knowing that nothing really changed despite my best effort, I sort of lost motivation for most things that semester, this project included, as I wasn’t so sure about what I want to do in coming semesters.</p><p>It was a bit hard to get myself to write code during that week of TP, remember laying on bed, wishing everything to be over soon, only to wake up the next morning, found out nothing has really changed, and there are now more works left for me to do.</p><p>Not the best time I had in college, but this was also the time where I get to think back on my college experience, adjust my expectaions, and reflect them directly on my project in the end. Going back to reaching out and listening to others, turns out I wasn’t the only person who felt that way in a global pandemic, and surprisingly, not the only one who struggled to complete things. Thanks to everyone that I met during that period of time, was able to collect myself together, and finished this project at the last possible minute.</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>I got more out of this project than I have contributed to it, and felt quite grateful on what I’ve experienced, along with everything I’ve learned. I am still passive, uncurious, blunt, and still have a hard time understanding people around me, but realizing that there are more than one way I can resolve this, and I don’t have to do this along, this was probably the best lesson I got in 2020 :D.</p>]]></content>
    
    
    <summary type="html">Knowing little about coding coming into the University, I didn&#39;t expect myself to have this fun creating something I had in mind. It was also, one of the turning point for me I would say? As it setted me up for things I never thought would be possible for me.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="../images/12202019.jpg" alt="With some of my relatives, Ina and Lolo :D" style=""><span class="image-caption">With some of my relatives, Ina and Lolo :D</span><p>This is the second time I was in China since I left. Shocked by how modern my city has became, I was more drawn to the people I got to meet, as it has being just about 3 years since we last chatted.</p><h2 id="Lolo-and-Ina"><a href="#Lolo-and-Ina" class="headerlink" title="Lolo and Ina"></a>Lolo and Ina</h2><p>If you can’t see it from the picture above, I really like Lolo and Ina :D. Three years no see, we still had a good time chatting at the dinner, hearing things happening in the new school Lolo went to, plus all the fun things happened at Ina’s kindergarden.</p><p>5 years apart from Lolo and 12 years apart from Ina, I was always surprised how similar we are. We all played piano when we were kids, enjoyed watching cartoons, and likes to order 东坡肉 when we are at a resterant.</p><h2 id="Kimi"><a href="#Kimi" class="headerlink" title="Kimi"></a>Kimi</h2><p>Kimi was one of the only non-relatives that we visited during our stay. We lived in the same neighborhood back in China, played together for a few times, and have known each other ever since.</p><p>If I was surprised when I met Lolo and Ina, I was shocked when I met Kimi lol. Recently with COVID, has being video chatting with Kimi every now and then. Independent, active, and competitive, she is now studying at a high school in the UK, playing lacross and compete for her high school team, started learning German, taught herself both C and Python, and have coded programs that would take me hours to code myself :’). Kimi wants to major in Math and Computer science when she is in college, and want to be a reseracher/mathmatian once she graduate.</p><p>Kimi’s passion towards winning, her sense of presistance across whatever she is intreted in, has always being something that I looked up to. She is probably prepping for her college aplication as I am writing this, wish her best of luck out there :D.</p><h2 id="Grandpa"><a href="#Grandpa" class="headerlink" title="Grandpa"></a>Grandpa</h2><p>When I felt everything has changed, my grandpa stayed, eh, exactly the same lol. Still the same hobby, same stories that he tells, same color of jacket when going outside, and the same facial expression when we finally needed to leave.</p><p>Being in the army for most of his life, my grandpa kept his rountine 20 years after he retired. He would often wake up at around 5:30 in the morning, take a hour long walk around the West Lake, buy some breakfast at the stand he always goes to, walk back to the house, sit in the living room, watch 朝闻天下 while eating his breakfast at exactly 7.</p><p>Why do I know these, well, waking me up at 5:30 and drag me on his walk happens to be a part of his routine while I was there :’).</p><p>Aside from this rather unpleasent experience though, I did enjoy the stay with my grandpa. We would play chinese chess together and laugh at each other’s play (okay mostly mine) for the whole afternoon, walk to the grocery market to get dinner, and talk about all the changes in the city while I wasn’t here.</p><p>My grandpa refers people at my school as 美国佬, the language we speak as 美国话, and ask me to teach him that one day, so he could come to my place for a visit. He still doesn’t know which school that I went to, but this never gets in the way of him showing how proud he is about me, whether it’s in person, or on video chats yesterday :).</p><h2 id="Ending-thoughts"><a href="#Ending-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending thoughts"></a>Ending thoughts</h2><p>Aside from how fast time flied, realized how people centric I am from this trip. Didn’t feel much when I walked around my elementary school, but memories flushed back after talking with teachers who used to teach me there, the exact same with my relatives, Kimi, and grandpa. It was a great time meeting these people again, happy that we got the chance to go back and visit.</p>]]></content>

Our friends and parents filled the entire stadium hours before the ceremony started, and the local police had to come and help direct the traffic lol.</p><p>The ceremony itself was, quite exciting, it was a place for everyone to celebrate the past, present, and future all at the same time. I didn’t remember most of it to be honest, but was quite happy when the principle handed me the diploma. Using my host family’s word, I am offically an educated man now B).</p><p>Thinking back to my four years at this school, I honestly can’t recall anything significant. I took courses just as every other student in the school would, tried my best to maintain GPA, did swim and water polo for a few semesters, met some friends, and yeah, that’s about it :). I didn’t feel much of a connection to this school or my class, as most of the people I knew have gradued a year in advance.</p><p>At the time I already knew where I would be going next fall for univeristy, and was pretty excited for it. I didn’t pay too close of an attention to the ceremony, in that very moment, my mind has already wondered to college, eager to find out what my next four year is going to be like.</p><p>Uncertainty, relief, along with a bit of excitment? It was an intresting experience overall, felt this ceremony was more like a new begining, compare to an end.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="../images/06262018.jpg" alt="Picture taken at Pike's Place with my mom, first Starbucks :D" style="width:50%; height:50%;"><span class="image-caption">Picture taken at Pike's Place with my mom, first Starbucks :D</span><p>Being the first trip I planned from begining to end, have ran into quite a few issues. Just about a year has past since the trip, thought it would be nice for me to record these thoughts, just in case I have do someting similar in the future.</p><h2 id="Make-a-More-Versatile-Plan"><a href="#Make-a-More-Versatile-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Make a More Versatile Plan"></a>Make a More Versatile Plan</h2><p>The third day that we were in Seattle, we got stucked in the hotel elevator, when we tried to come down and grab some breakfast :’). Luckly noo one died in the end (except the hotel manager lol), but we did lose a few precious hour of that morning, and the plan I got for the day had to be cancelled. In the end, we walked around Pike’s Place and took some pictures, checkout the image above if you want a reference :D.</p><p>What I realized was that, rather than making a plan composed entirely on when to do what, should have instead, make another category of things we can do at any given moment. Walk around Pike’s Place, visit the Central Public Library, or even just to go and checkout the Chinatown. These events, although trivial, would make a trip more fluid and flexible, helps me better adjust to the current situation of the trip.</p><h2 id="Have-Half-of-Day-of-Nothing"><a href="#Have-Half-of-Day-of-Nothing" class="headerlink" title="Have Half of Day of Nothing"></a>Have Half of Day of Nothing</h2><p>So I did have that on my original plan, but mainly because I ran out of things to do lol.</p><p>It was an afternoon towards the end of the trip, me and my mom ended up sitting in the hotel room, and chatted about the trip as a whole, things that we individually saw, funny pictures we took, and reflections we had.</p><p>To my surprise, that afternoon became one of the highlights through the trip. I did enjoy walking around the city and visiting new places, but really appreciate that short afternoon of doing nothing, reflecting things that we did, and exchange thoughts on how we can improve.</p><p>Might be because who I was with, my mom, who is much wiser and more mature than me. However, when places we visit would eventually get forgotten, soviourers we bought would at one day be thrown away, I still remember reflections my mom had, along with things that she said. This half day of nothing may be different for everyone, a time to organize pictures they took, a moment to catch up on sleep, but for me, thought it was a great oppotunity, getting feedback from the trip, and take notes on how I can do better on the next.</p><h2 id="Enjoy-the-Trip"><a href="#Enjoy-the-Trip" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy the Trip"></a>Enjoy the Trip</h2><p>Really didn’t think about this until much later after the trip, but with more trips I took throughout the year, looking back, I didn’t quite ‘enjoy’ this trip compare to the other. I was solely looking for popular places around Seattle, and blindly adding them to the trip plan.</p><p>My mom enjoys taking pictures, so Chinatown or a longer visit at Chihuly Garden of Glass, would probably have being a better option for her. I perfer going somewhere quiet and just sit there, so should have marked a longer day trip at Mount Rainier, or even make a stop at the public library.</p><p>Now all that being said, it took me a while to figure out what I enjoyed on a trip. Nonetheless, do felt like I could have done a better job, at least at communciating with my parents while making the travel plan, asking them what their preference was, and make a trip that they would have enjoyed more.</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>Truth be told, I still didn’t know where Seattle is at, even after we finished the trip lol. But it was, all in all, a great time visiting there :D.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thinking back to my stay, these three puppies were almost always the first thing that cames to my mind. Being someone who never really had a pet, dealing with three was, quite an unique experience.</p><h2 id="Wofie"><a href="#Wofie" class="headerlink" title="Wofie"></a>Wofie</h2><img src="../images/03182018b.jpeg" alt="Wofie, not very happy that the shutter sound woke him up" style="width:80%; height:80%;"><span class="image-caption">Wofie, not very happy that the shutter sound woke him up</span><p>Wofie is the cloest defnition I have, if you asked me what a dog is like 5 years ago. Active, loyal, attention craving, as a Schnauzer with a giant ego, Wofie is, well, not very pleasent to interact with, to say the very least :’).</p><p>I tend prefer peace and quiet, so the sole existance of Wofie has, bothered me a little. He would be running around the house constantly, marking his territory, asserting his dominance over the other two (and sometimes me), if we ever left him unchecked for more than ten minutes. He would come over and yell at us if we are having too much fun without him at the dinner, and brak for hours, just to chase the bird outside away, who is merely trying to built a nest.</p><p>As unpleasent as he was to deal with, as the most straightforward one out of all three, Wofie was the first that I was able to understood. If he barks he wants to go outside, if he growls someone is in his way, and if he does anything else, well, he is probably looking for a treat…</p><p>Thinking back, Wofie might just have being the most brilliant human trainer I have met. He is honest, straightforward, doesn’t hide away his feelings and never overthinks, which helped us greatly to gave him what he wanted.</p><h2 id="Lizzy"><a href="#Lizzy" class="headerlink" title="Lizzy"></a>Lizzy</h2><img src="../images/03182018.jpeg" alt="Lizzy, sleeping on the bed where I sleep :')" style="width:50%; height:50%;"><span class="image-caption">Lizzy, sleeping on the bed where I sleep :')</span><p>A Dachshund and Schnauzer mix, Lizzy remained as my host family’s favorite through my time there. She is ‘Liz’ for host mom, and ‘my baby girl’ for host dad. She enjoys the first 10 minutes of every walk, likes to sleep on the sofa whenever someoen is there, and loves to destory toys, whenever we buy her something squeaky :’).</p><p>Aside from her charisma, Lizzy has a sense of curiocity that can only be found from a puppy. She would come and sniff every package delivered at the front porch, and meeting new people with some lick on the face. In the summer of 2017, that curiocity got her bitten by a rattle snake, along with three nights of stay in the pet hospital. After that the urge of getting to know everything has rapidly cooled down, though still, whenever she would hear someone standing at the door, she would still rush to the door, stand up with her tails swingglings from side to side, just to see who is there.</p><h2 id="Ares"><a href="#Ares" class="headerlink" title="Ares"></a>Ares</h2><img src="../images/03182018c.jpeg" alt="Ares with his innocent look" style="width:80%; height:80%;"><span class="image-caption">Ares with his innocent look</span><p>The host family’s son adopted Ares and named him after the god of war. Contrary to this aggresive name though, as a pit bull, Ares is surprisingly chill and quite, just like me B).</p><p>Sleeping and walking are really the only two activies Ares does. On a typicaly day, he would drag himself to the living room sofa, lay there comfortably until the afternoon, where the host mom (and sometimes I) would take him for a walk. After the walk, he would return to his favorite spot on the sofa, sleep there until the evening, where he would go to my host dad’s room and enjoy the rest of the night there.</p><p>As low energy as Ares sound, he turns into a different dog whenever he is outside. He would drag me forward, dig holes on the ground, bite the leash and growls at me if I am going too slow :’).</p><p>Ares loves anywhere but the house, to the point where he ran away, twice, during the time of my stay. The first time he ran all the way to my high school (which is about 10 minutes by car and 30 minutes by foot), and got carried back by some very kind construction workers across the street. The second time he appeantly he ran to the other side of the hill, it was late at night, all we knew was, he got taken back by a even nicer driver who, eh, almost hit him on the street.</p><p>We now get nervous evertime Ares eyes at the front door lol, though as troublesome as he is, would say Ares has been a great partner whenever I decides to do work at the living room sofa. He never craves for attention, seldomly barks even when there are bird chipping outside, and simply rolls over if he wants some belly scarch, letting me enjoys my afternoon without constantly looking out for him :).</p><h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>It would be an exaggeration compare these dogs to people I lived with during my stay, though I do think back to these interactions, more than any students who were there. Always be on my bed when I wanted to take a nap, swallow food on the floor faster than I could pick them back up, play dead and smile at exactly halfway of a walk, still not sure if I ever enjoyed their company. Nonetheless though, being something that has feelings and emotions, they were one of the first creatures that I actively try to understand, and something that still lingers around my memory, even today :).</p>]]></content>

As for personality, got ISFP for Myers Briggs, and a type 6 for Enneagram. Don’t really know what these meant but, just thought it may be cool to put it here.</p><p>My favorite color is grey, favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla, enjoy listening to lofi hip hop musics, play both Minecraft and Terraria, currently ranked Iron II in League of Legend, and love cats and dogs equally :].</p><p>Aside from school, usually enjoy spending time by myself. Reading, playing video games, translating, writing jounrals, etc. Though recently did start exploring things I don’t typically do, took a few lessons at a dance studio, learned a bit about acapella, watched a few series on Netflix, attempted to draw using Figma, and applied to be a volunteer at Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic. They were, surprisingly fun I would say? Do think I also appreciate making connections with people other than myself, doing things together in a group.</p><h2 id="About-This-Website"><a href="#About-This-Website" class="headerlink" title="About This Website"></a>About This Website</h2><p>As mentioned in <a target="_self" href="https://yizeshen7.github.io/about/">About</a>, was planning on using this site as a place to record my life and occasionally, thoughts and feelings.</p><p>Like any elder man you see walking on the street, I also tend to forget about things easily :’). To combat servere memory loses, started jounraling back in 2019, just to have a place to put down things I wish to remember. Overtime, felt jounraling has helped me relive my state of mind whenever I look back, so wish this website to be the same.</p><p>Aside from recording my life, want to use this website as a tool to improve my communciation skills. Compare to most people I met who are my age, often felt not as efficiente, formulating thoughts and expressing them in a concise way. Don’t think writing posts on a website would directly help me with that, but hey, for an introvert, this is a giant leap I am taking buddy :’).</p><p>Lastly, if anything, want to use this site for others who wish to know a bit about me. Consider myself pretty straightforward and simple minded, but also realized that, too often I would keep opinons/thoughts/ideas to myself, rather than expressing them to my counterparts. I don’t wish to be a mystery to most people, and especially people who I surround myself with. This website is intended to be a passive way for me to share a bit about who I am and what I’ve experienced, just incase you are curious :].</p><p>All in all, plan to use this website to record my life, practice my writing skills, and let others to know a bit more about me. Curious to see how this would go, and yeah, thanks for reading.</p><p>On a side note, if you are reading this and have a way to contact me, feel free to reach out! Would love to hear thoughts and feedbacks, if you have any :D.</p>]]></content>
