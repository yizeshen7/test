<p>Being the first trip I planned from begining to end, have to admit that I ran into quite a few issues throughout. Just about a year has past since the trip, thought it would be a valuable for me to record my thoughts, just in case I have do someting similar in the future.</p>
<h2 id="Make-a-More-Versatile-Plan"><a href="#Make-a-More-Versatile-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Make a More Versatile Plan"></a>Make a More Versatile Plan</h2><p>To start off, what I didn’t think through the trip, was how differnt a travel plan is compare to a regular plan, there are just, much more uncertain things throughout, and a more flexible plan was something I wish I had kept in mind before the trip.</p>
<p>The third day that we were in Seattle, we unfortunately got stucked in the hotel elevator, when we tried to come down and grab some breakfast :’). Luckly No one died in the end (except the hotel manager lol), but we did lose a few precious hour of that morning, and the plan I got for the day had to be cancelled. In the end, we walked around Pike’s Place and took some pictures, checkout the image above if you want a reference :D.</p>
<p>What I realized is that, rather than making a plan composed entirely on when to do what, should have instead, make another category of things we can do at any given moment. Walk around Pike’s Place, visit the Central Public Library, or even just go checkout the Chinatown. These events, although trivial, would make a trip more fluid and flexible, help me better adjust to the current situation of the trip.</p>
<p>Don’t except myself to get stuck in a hotel elevator again anytime soon, but do felt that, if I could have gone back and remake the trip plan, would probably have spent more time research things to do at Pike’s Place, along with other places to check out. Though on a side note, do enjoy surprises during a trip, and Pike’s Place was, honeslty a very nice place to walk around.</p>
<h2 id="Have-Half-of-Day-of-Nothing"><a href="#Have-Half-of-Day-of-Nothing" class="headerlink" title="Have Half of Day of Nothing"></a>Have Half of Day of Nothing</h2><p>So I did have that on my original plan, but mainly because I ran out of things to put lol.</p>
<p>It was an afternoon towards the end of the trip, me and my mom ended up sat in the hotel room, chatted about the week as a whole, things that we individually saw, funny pictures we took, and reflections we had for the trip.</p>
<p>To my surprise, that afternoon became one of the highlights through the trip. I did enjoy walking around the city and visiting different places, but really appreciate that short afternoon of doing nothing, reflecting things that we did, and exchange thoughts/feelings in general.</p>
<p>Might be because who I was with, my mom was much wiser and more mature than me. However, when places we visit eventually gets forgotten, soviourers we bought would at one day be thrown away, I still, till this very day, remember reflections mom had, along with things that she said. This half day of nothing may be different for everyone, a time to organize pictures they took, some to catch up on sleep, but for me, thought it was a great oppotunity, getting feedback from the trip, and take notes on how I can do better.</p>
<h2 id="Enjoy-the-Trip"><a href="#Enjoy-the-Trip" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy the Trip"></a>Enjoy the Trip</h2><p>Really didn’t think about this until much later after the trip, but with more trips I took throughout the year, looking back, I didn’t make a plan that made neither me or my mom happy for the trip. I was solely looking for popular places around Seattle, and blindly adding them to the trip plan.</p>
<p>My mom enjoys taking pictures, so Chinatown or a longer visit at Chihuly Garden of Glass, would probably have being a better option for her. I perfer going somewhere quiet and sit there for a day, so should have marked up a longer day trip at Mount Rainier, or even make a stop at the public library, when we have just walked right passed it during the trip.</p>
<p>Now all that being said, it did take me a while to figure out what I enjoy on a trip, be fore I had this thought at all of making a trip enjoyable. Nonetheless, do felt like I could have done a better job, at least at communciating with my mom while making the travel plan, ask her what her preference was, and make a trip that she would have enjoyed more.</p>
<h2 id="Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h2><p>Truth be told, I still didn’t know where Seattle is at, even after we finished the trip lol. But it was, all in all, a great time visiting Seattle, we visited Space Needle and the Glass Museum, walked around Pike’s Places twice, and dine out at some nice resterants. The weather during the trip was also amazing, only had one cloudy day throughout the trip, and it was not until January of 2021 that I realized, Seattle has almost all cloudy days throughout the year :’).</p>
<p>At this point, with people I’ve met and places I’ve been, I am confident about making a better plan. With that being said though, this trip has being a precious experience for the same exact reason. All the regrets/mistakes I made helped me grow to a more mature person, and this trip has definitely become a time that I compare myself to :D.</p>
