      <description>Knowing little about coding coming into the University, I didn&#39;t expect myself to have this fun creating something I had in mind. It was also, one of the turning point for me I would say? As it setted me up for things I never thought would be possible for me.</description>

      <description>Whenever I talk about my host family, these three puppies are one of the first thing that came to my mind. Not that they played that important of a role, but a sense of consistancy was something that always kept them in my mind.</description>
